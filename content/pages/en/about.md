Well, nice to meet you, I'm Julio. 

I've been working with python since 2012 at least, and I already had a blog about Python with this same name from around 2010 to 2016. Unfortunately, not everything went as I would like and I ended away from the blog for 6 years or so.

Meanwhile I basically lost everything I've written before so I'm starting over again.

I have a BSc in Computer Science at Unifei (Brazil), I have participated as a speaker of many Python conferences all over Brazil and today I live in Denmark.

I hope to share a little of my experiences and knowledge with you!

See you in the next post!!
